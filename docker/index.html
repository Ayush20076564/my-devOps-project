            <h3>This is my DevOps pipeline</h3>
            <p> This DevOps pipeline successfully met its main goal: to automate the deployment of a static web application in a way that is consistent, 
                repeatable, and efficient by using open-source tools and cloud infrastructure. 
                The process greatly reduced the need for manual effort, sped up deployment times, and ensured the results could be reliably reproduced.</p>
